# Source code for Svelte Tutorials at MDN Web docs

Source code of the To-Do list app for the Svelte tutorials at [Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks](Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks) series at MDN Web docs.

## 06. Working with Svelte stores

In the last article we completed the development of our app, organized it into components, and saw a couple of advanced techniques for dealing with reactivity, working with DOM nodes and exposing components functionality. In this case we will have a look at Svelte stores: a global data repository that holds value and that allows you to subscribe to it and get notified when the value changes. We will also see how to develop our own custom store to persist the todos information to local storage.

You can see the complete content of this article [here](../06-stores/Svelte_stores.md) or at [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_stores).

The source code to follow this article is in the `06-stores` folder, you can download it with the `npx degit opensas/mdn-svelte-tutorial/06-stores svelte-todo` command. You can also play with an online version using this Svelte [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/d1fa84a5a4494366b179c87395940039?version=3.23.2).

# svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).


## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for *any* path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```


## Deploying to the web

### With [now](https://zeit.co/now)

Install `now` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g now
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
now deploy --name my-project
```

As an alternative, use the [Now desktop client](https://zeit.co/download) and simply drag the unzipped project folder to the taskbar icon.

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public my-project.surge.sh
```
